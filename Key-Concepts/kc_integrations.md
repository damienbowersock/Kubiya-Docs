# What are Kubiya's Integrations?

Kubiya allows for integration with several external systems to extend functionality and provide the basis for automation across the enterprise.

## Internal Integrations
Internal Integrations allow you to connect Kubiya to external systems for the purpose of interacting with the Kubiya Engine. Unlike action stores, internal integrations are provided by Kubiya and do not need to be built from scratch.

An example of an Internal Integration is the Slack integration. This integration allows you to connect Kubiya to Slack and allows users to perform workflows from the Slack Interface, eliminating the need for an external UI.

Several Internal Integrations are available, including Slack, Jira and AWS.  For an up-to-date list of available integrations, please refer to the Integrations page in the Operator Guide.
