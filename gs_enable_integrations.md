# Enabling Integrations from the CLI

Integrating Kubiya with other applications provides extended functionality allows the workflows to interact with the outside world.  For instance, given a certain event or approval that is required, you may want to open a ticket in Jira.  Kubiya supports Integrations with Slack, Jira, AWS and several identity providers.
