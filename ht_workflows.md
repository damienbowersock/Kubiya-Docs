# Workflows

Workflows are step-by-step automation recipes that allow a user to accomplish a task or series of tasks via Kubiya.

Workflows can be hosted in your favorite source control system, a local directory on your computer or even on a provider's website.

Workflows are created or imported through the Kubiya CLI or imported through the Kubiya Slack interface.  Once created or imported the workflow is uploaded to Kubiya and executed remotely when initiated.
