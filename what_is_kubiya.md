# What is Kubiya?

Kubiya is a SaaS platform that utilizes conversation AI to automate and orchestrate common DevOps functions in a self-service way.  Kubiya's extensible workflow engine allows operators and users to create a nearly endless array of automations that minimize manual and repetitive tasks.

User interaciton with Kubiya is designed to be flexible and easy to understand.  Leveraging a powerful, conversational AI engine, Kubiya can understand and translate natural language commands to interface with traditional, syntax driven platforms and operating systems.

## Kubiya Platform

The Kubiya Platform is comprised of a combination of Workflows, Actions, Integrations and Policies.  Workflows define the patterns of behavior and are comprised of individual Actions.  Integrations define the systems that Kubiya is allowed to interact with and policies allow for granular control of what users can and cannot do when interacting with Kubiya.
